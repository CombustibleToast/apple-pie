		You trod down the path towards the clearing -- and grandma is there, sitting on a stump quietly.
		You think she is humming something casually...
		She turns to you as you approach. "...Hello, Dot."
	dot
		"..." You nod cordially.
		"Good morning, Granny."
		"What's on the docket for today?"
	granny 
		"The ritual..." Her brows furrow mysteriously. 
		"We must complete it..." She clears her throat. 
		"[i]You[/i] must... It is... vital!"
	dot
		You look nervously at Granny. She's usually like this, but something is off this time.
		"What should I do? How can I help?"
	granny
		A smile cracks across her face.
		"Collect the necessary ingredients, my dear grandchild."
		She gazes into the forest around you. As though to punctuate her point, leaves casually tumble from the trees.
		"...[b]Three fruits[/b] of the first sin."
		"A sacred [b]gift of Demeter[/b]."
		"And... some [b]white-gold[/b] powder."
		She cackles as she turns back to the campfire, and imbues her gaze with all the spirit it can muster. 
		"Now, go, Dot!"
	dot
		You stammer a moment, before...
		...nodding confidently. "OK, Granny."
