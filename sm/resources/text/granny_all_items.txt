# Played when the player speaks to granny once they've collected all the items
start
	granny
		"Ah..." She nods to your approach.
		"Hello, my child!" She smiles warmly. "Have you collected all the required ingredients yet?"
	dot
		Your hefty basket is a bit much for your childly arms to carry.
		"I think, granny!"
	granny 
		A familiar smile cracks across her face.
		Her eyes issue a sense of resolved urgency.
		"Well done, Dot. We may now begin the ritual." 
		"Come," she says, patting a seat next to her. "Join me at the campfire."
	dot
		You set the basket down nearby Granny.
		"...Is this ritual part of my training?"
	granny
		"Of a sort..." She laughs. "It is a good day for physical labor!" 
		"Now, keep the fire warm..."
		"And we shall go to work!"
