		"What do you have there, Vim?"
	vim
		"Something from -- underneath!"
	dakota
		Your mimicked words, if not the [url=dragging]heavy dragging noise[/url], draw their attention away from dinner, which continues to make itself.
	box
		The box in your talons is old and well-crafted, made of wood well-hewn, covered in a thick layer of dust.
		Looks like it hasn't been touched in a century, which...
		Well, knowing the mistress and his fancies, that is entirely possible.
	stew
		Stew dips through the air, indicating the coffee table. The expression on Stew's face is as placid as ever.
		"..."
	vim
		You give the assistant's assistant a little nod.
	box
		With your mage hand and claws together, you heft the box. It is heavier, even more than you expect. 
		...Your grip fails! The box [b]strikes[/b] the table. 
		A loud clatter rings out like a thousand little pieces are inside.
	vim
		"Sorry, sorry," you mumble.
		"It's a secret for you and me..."

	dakota
		She smiles warmly. "It's no matter..."

!dragging
		The weight is a lot to bear... you weren't exactly trying to be stealthy.

what
	vim
		"What is?" You gesture vaguely at the box with your wings.
	dakota
		She laughs. "You're the one who brought it all the way up the stairs..."
	vim
		"It was... pretty. Looked important!"
		"Oh, and, Stew -- Stew helped!" You gesture at the shark-shaped water elemental.
	dakota
		The witch glances to Stew accusatorily, a playful smile on his lips. 
		"Did YOU tell aer what it is?"
	stew
		"..."
		As though Stew didn't hear, the shark drifts along, away from you and the Witch, and back into the stairwell.
	vim
		Dakota's attention is back on you. You must make the most of your guess. 
		"It is... a game! I think..."
	dakota
		The witch's eyes scan the box more analytically.
		Suddenly, her face changes. "...Oh, no way!" 
		"It was down there all this time, huh..."
	vim
		"What?" you say, in alarm. "What what what?"
	dakota
		"Steer clear, feather duster." She draws a steady breath.
		"[code]PoUi'SaPa, Uy'CaFaAn.[/code]"
		The magic words follow the motion of her wrist... 
	box
		...and the dust begins to fade.
		The wooden shell is significantly less gray than before... and significantly more [url=intricate]ornate[/url], that you can tell.
		Runes line the corners of the box... But you've no idea what they mean.
	vim
		But the mistress's words... You know them. And... it was something about the way she said...
		"...'Good friend'?"
	dakota
		They laugh gently, in amazement. The Graven Witch seems more remiss than usual.
		"I can't believe I held onto this," she bemuses breathlessly. "Take a look here, V."
	box
		The witch slides a gloved finger along the edge of the box, through the dust. The inscription in a language you cannot read is unveiled.
		Dakota reads the inscription aloud:
		[b]"THE SIX DEATHS".[/b]
		Candles in the corners of the room dance and flicker. Your feathers feel the cool wind...
	vim
		"Is it... A game?" you chitter nervously. "Or is it a 'friend'?"
	dakota
		She nods to your puzzled expression. "It's a game, alright. THE game of my younger years..."
		"And a... friend, of sorts?" he smirks. "A companion, for sure."
		"I think these days it's called [b]Knifepoint[/b]?" they say. "I can explain some more about it..."
		"...or you could crack this thing open and learn more yourself." She waves a hand over the box. "Your choice."
	LINK@vim
		>deadly : "Is it... deadly?"

!intricate
		You see a lattice of beams across its surface: some arcanized iron, some toughened elvenwood, some you can't place. A hodgepodge of materials, interwoven... or reinforced, remade over time?

deadly
	vim
		Your feathers puff up.
		"Six deaths? Knifepoint?" you say sheepishly. "Does the game... kill?"
	dakota
		Reassuringly, the witch shakes her head. "Nah. It's just an allusion."
		"...Supposedly." They smirk.
	vim
		"T-to what?"
	dakota
		"It's, ah..." Her ears flutter nervously. 
		"Ancient, ancient history; records really are only kept only by the [url=mchild]moon-children[/url]."
		Her gaze flits to the space over the grand fireplace, where a map of Bullion hangs.
		"It's said that when they were first born into this world, they took with them knowledge of doom..."
		"They called it something like, the '[b]Existences of Death[/b]', plural..."
	vim
		It is possible some of this is ringing a bell...
		You stare at the map of Bullion with a renewed curiosity.
	dakota
		"...So, this knowledge became a part of their broader culture when they came here."
		"[i]Six Deaths bring the first of wars; to set the truth, to find the door...[/i]" she mumbles in a sing-songy voice.
		She closes her eyes for a moment, smiles, as though remembering something, then looks back at you. 
		"...Never heard any of that?"
	vim
		You shake your head. You've never heard most of these words before in your life.
	dakota
		He smirks coyly. "...I sometimes forget you're not from the Wild Blue."
		"Either way, it's not a super important name. It's just an allusion to [b]the game's creators[/b]."
		"The name has some significance to ludology, but really... it's just a game with dice." They smile. "Harmless."
	vim
		"What is a... ludology?"
	dakota
		"It's like... research about games...?" She clears her throat. "It's not really important, heh."
		They look over the box. "I had a very stern teacher about this type of cultural stuff... and..."
		Dakota's expression changes visibly.
		"Well, hey, I bet some of my old notes are still in this thing."

!mchild
	"Y'know, the harengon?" She smiles back at you. "Rabbitfolk, some say..."
