class_name Focusable
extends Node

## Intended to be used inside every focusable object (re: hoverable, selectable gameplay object) to create glow and targeting.
## Objects can restrict whether or not specific players can only hover them or select them. 
## Order and position of Focusable objects will also be usable by a controller user akin to elements in an RPG-menu.
